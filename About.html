                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a professionally qualified fire engineer with 7 years experience.
                         I have recently achieved RTITB accreditation in the use of Counterbalance fork lift trucks,
                          and I am seeking employment that will make best use of my skills and allow me to develop them further.
                           I am determined and enthusiastic,
                            I have developed good planning & organisational skills and am confident working independently or as part of a team.
                             I am flexible regarding working hours and am able to work a range of shifts.
                             I’m a nice fun and friendly person, I’m honest and punctual,
                              I work well in a team but also on my own as I like to set myself goals which I will achieve,
                               I have good listening and communication skills. I have a creative mind and am always up for new challenges.
                                I am well organized and always plan ahead to make sure I manage my time well</p>
                    <p>Listening to music has always been my go to activity for all occasions. My love for music can be traced back to when I was a child.
                         There are recorded videos of me as a child becoming hyperactive whenever music was played. I would run to the stereo,
                          turn on the music to full volume and start running around dancing. Anyone who dared touch the sound system would face my wrath
                          . Music was the only thing that could calm me down whenever I cried.
                        I always have this weird feeling that my destiny is somehow intertwined with music.
                         In my early teenage years, my girlfriends and I would sneak into the garage,
                          where my brother and his band mates kept their musical equipment.
                           Then, we would pluck guitar strings and knock the drums in an effort to compose our favorite songs.
                            I was the lead singer by the way.</p>

                        <p>Travelling is one of those few activities that has a kind of reset button in our lives.
                             You go away for a few days or weeks and come back fresh and ready to take on challenges of life head on.
                              Travelling to many people is a matter of convenience, rather than a recreation activity.
                               They only travel when they have an issue to attend to. Travelling is also not for escapists, as many people tend to believe.
                                I used the word ‘escapists’ not in the literary sense of the word, but rather to mean people who run away from their problems.
                                 Travelling is a hobby like any other.
                            Most people do not understand how moving from one place to another can be categorized together with fun activities like watching movies,
                             swimming, dancing or drawing. While it has more challenges than other hobbies,
                              it is more adventurous and brings the same level of satisfaction or more for those who love it.
                            Travelling has always been part of our family tradition.
                             My parents taught us from an early age the value of taking vacations at least once a year.
                              Though they wished we could go for many trips annually, we were not well off financially and my parents had to work creatively with the little they had,
                               sometimes saving the whole year for a single trip. </p>

                        <p>I’m passionate about reading. Although I have several hobbies, such as watching movies and hiking, reading books is what resonates well with me.
                             There are many reasons why I love reading. The first reason is it gives me a level of fulfillment.
                              That is, books rejuvenate me. After reading a book, I feel like a whole new being and my outlook in life changes.
                            The second reason is books make my mind sharp. It is a known fact that books improve our brain muscles.
                             They make us think better and improve our decision making abilities. I find it funny that whenever I utter a clever quote from a book,
                              everyone around me would be dumbfounded.                           
                            Furthermore, books are very wide and detailed. It seems like there is a book for anything you can think of. If you want religious books,
                             there is the Bible, the Muran and other spiritual books. </p>
